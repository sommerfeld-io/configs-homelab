# kroki

Kroki is an open-source service that generates diagrams from textual descriptions using various diagram syntaxes (such as PlantUML, Mermaid, Graphviz, and more). Instead of drawing diagrams by hand, you write the diagram's structure in text, and Kroki renders it as an image.

This app deploys a Kroki server to your Kubernetes (k8s) cluster, allowing you to create and render diagrams on demand via HTTP API.
