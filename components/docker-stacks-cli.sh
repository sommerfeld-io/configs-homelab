# @brief Command line interface to control Docker Compose services on your local machine.
# @description
#   This Bash script that acts as a command line interface to control Docker Compose services on
#   your local machine. The script provides an easy-to-use interface for managing your Docker
#   Compose services, allowing you to start, stop, and restart your containers with a few simple
#   commands. It is intended to simplify the management of Docker Compose services by providing a
#   set of convenient and intuitive commands that allow you to control your containers quickly and
#   easily.
#
#   The script auto-detects the services from the filesystem and provides a select menu to choose a
#   stack. Once you select the stack, the script will provide you with a set of commands to manage
#   the containers within from the respective Docker Compose definition.
#
#   This script is intended to simplify the management of Docker Compose services on your local
#   machine. It provides a convenient, consistent and reproducible way to manage the Docker
#   containers through an easy-to-use interface that allows you to control your containers quickly
#   and efficiently.
#
#   ### Prerequisites
#   Before using this script, you need to ensure that Docker and Docker Compose is installed on the
#   system. The script assumes that the Docker engine is running, and the user has necessary
#   permissions to execute Docker commands.
#
#   ### Usage
#   The script does not accept any parameters.
