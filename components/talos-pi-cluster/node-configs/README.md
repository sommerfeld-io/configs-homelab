# Talos Node Configs

The config files inside this repo are auto-generated and downloaded to this location.

The `*-patch.yml` files however are manually created and are used to patch the Talos config files (meaning the are an input for generating the Talos config files).

See `docs/nodes/talos/installation.md` for more information on how to generate the config files.
