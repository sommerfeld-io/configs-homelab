# Role: Packages

With `tasks_from: main` this role installs packages, which are common to all machines, via the system package manager. This should be run as `root`.

With `tasks_from: ubuntu` this role installs packages specific to Ubuntu-based systems. This should be run as `root`.

With `tasks_from: raspi` this role installs packages specific to Raspberry Pi systems. This should be run as `root`.

First, run `tasks_from: main`, then either `tasks_from: ubuntu` or `tasks_from: raspi`.

## Expected Variables

- `{{ ansible_user }}`: The user to install for (typically the logged-in user).
- `{{ architecture }}`: The system architecture (`amd64` or `arm64`).
