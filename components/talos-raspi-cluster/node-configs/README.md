# Talos Node Configs

The config files inside this repo are auto-generated and downloaded to this location by the Ansible playbook `components/ansible/playbooks/raspi-talos.yml`.

The files are written to the SD card of the Raspberry Pi nodes running Talos Linux to configure the nodes. This avoids the need to manually configure the nodes in an interactive way.

See playbook `components/ansible/playbooks/raspi-talos.yml` for more details.
