# @file Ops Compose Config
# @brief Docker stack for monitoring system metrics with Prometheus and Grafana.
# @description
#   The `ops` Docker stack is a Docker Compose configuration that manages
#   all of the needed exporters to monitor system metrics with Prometheus and Grafana. By
#   using the `ops` Docker stack, you can quickly and easily deploy all of the necessary
#   components for monitoring your system metrics. This includes exporters for various system
#   metrics, such as CPU usage, disk usage, and network activity.
