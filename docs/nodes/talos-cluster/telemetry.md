# Talos Cluster - Telemetry

The namespace `telemetry` contains all components related to monitoring, logging and observability of the Talos Kubernetes Cluster. The name `telemetry` is inspired by the concept of collecting and analyzing system data.

- Grafana UI: <http://talos-cp.fritz.box:30000>

## Prometheus & Grafana

The Prometheus & Grafana stack is deployed into the cluster itself through the [Prometheus Operator](https://prometheus-operator.dev/docs/getting-started/introduction). Prometheus Operator is a [Kubernetes Operator](https://github.com/cncf/tag-app-delivery/blob/main/operator-wg/whitepaper/Operator-WhitePaper_v1-0.md#foundation) that provides Kubernetes native deployment and management of [Prometheus](https://prometheus.io) and related monitoring components.

The Prometheus Operator is installed through a [Helm Chart](https://github.com/prometheus-community/helm-charts/tree/main/charts/kube-prometheus-stack). The installation is done by ArgoCD.

To access the Grafana UI, we added a `NodePort` service to the Grafana deployment. The service is exposed on port `30000`. We created a copy of the `kube-prometheus-stack-grafana` service inside the `telemetry` namespace and changed the service type to `NodePort`. The copy is named `kube-prometheus-stack-grafana-nodeport`.

- `node-exporter` is a Prometheus exporter for hardware and OS metrics exposed by *NIX kernels. It is shipped as part of the `kube-prometheus-stack` Helm Chart.
- `kube-state-metrics` is a simple service that listens to the Kubernetes API server and generates metrics about the state of the objects. It is shipped as part of the `kube-prometheus-stack` Helm Chart.

??? note "Not included in the default setup"
    - **Data Persistence:** By default, the operator configures Pods to store data on emptyDir volumes which arenâ€™t persisted when the Pods are redeployed. See <https://prometheus-operator.dev/docs/platform/storage>.
    - **Absent components**: The helm chart does not install all components of kube-prometheus, notably excluding the Prometheus Adapter and Prometheus black-box exporter. They may be added later if needed.

### ArgoCD metrics

Argo CD exposes different sets of Prometheus metrics per server. The Prometheus Operator scrapes the metrics from the Argo CD server through `ServiceMonitor` resources.

## Kubernetes Dashboard

The Kubernetes Dashboard is a general-purpose, web-based UI for Kubernetes clusters. It allows users to manage applications running in the cluster and troubleshoot them, as well as manage the cluster itself.

The Kubernetes Dashboard is deployed inside the Kubernetes cluster. In case the Prometheus-Grafana stack is down, we still have access to the Kubernetes Dashboard to inspect the cluster.

- Run `~/port-forward-kubernetes-dashboard.sh` from the Vagrantbox (`components/talos-cluster/virtual-talos-admin/Vagrantfile`) to retrieve a Bearer Token and to port-forward the Kubernetes Dashboards web interface.
