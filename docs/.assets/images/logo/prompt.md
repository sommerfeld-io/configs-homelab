# AI Prompt

Create a clean, modern illustration symbolizing the flow of infrastructure as code and automated provisioning, without using any text or logos. Use abstract, simplified icons—such as servers, terminals, cloud nodes, configuration files, pipelines, and network nodes—that together represent a declarative, code-driven process from configuration to running systems.

Arrange the elements to suggest a pipeline or workflow: starting from configuration files or code symbols (like gear-inscribed documents or CLI terminals), flowing through orchestrated stages (abstracted pipelines or arrows), and ending in deployed infrastructure components—such as abstracted nodes, clusters, or virtualized systems. Include elements that visually imply automation and orchestration—such as linked gears, branching lines, or pulsing dots—while maintaining clarity and simplicity.

Do not constrain the layout to a single line; instead, create a symmetrical and visually balanced composition with consistent spacing and visual weight. Emphasize modularity and flow across the illustration, with a sense of forward progression or transformation from code to infrastructure.

Use a transparent background. All icon shapes should be filled with #1E2129. Use #5e8bde for outlines, accents, or linking lines, and apply #ff6e42 sparingly as a highlight for subtle emphasis on key components or transitions. Outlines and borders should be present but not too bright—maintain contrast without overwhelming the dark base color.

The visual style should be flat or subtly dimensional, designed to suit the start page of a documentation website. Avoid any traditional branding elements (e.g., Kubernetes, Docker, cloud provider logos). The imagery should communicate the core idea of automated, reproducible infrastructure using code.
