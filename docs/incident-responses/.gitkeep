Add runbooks / instructions / incident response plans for grafana alerts.
Link to these markdown files (or the generated GitHub Pages) from the Alert.
Better link to this page because GitHub Pages do not always reflect the latest docs (due to our release process).

Add an index.md file and include in MkDocs. Link all incident response plans in index.md.
